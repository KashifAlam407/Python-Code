a = 8

## 1. if-elif-else ladder in python
if(a>12):
    print("The value of a is grater than 12")
elif(a>13):
    print("The value of a is greater than 13")
elif(a>7):
    print("The value of a is grater than 7")
elif(a>17):
    print("The value of a is grater than 17")
else:
    print("The value of a is grater than 3 or 7")


## 2. Multiple if statesment
# if(a>12):
#     print("The value of a is grater than 12")
# if(a>3):
#     print("The value of a is greater than 3")
# if(a>7):
#     print("The value of a is grater than 7")
# if(a>17):
#     print("The value of a is grater than 17")
# else:
#     print("The value of a is grater than 3 or 7")
# print("Done")


# b = 22
# if(b>9):
#     print("Greater")
# else:
#     print("Lesser")
